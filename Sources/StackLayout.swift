     The `direction` property establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container.
     
     The `direction` property specifies how flex items are laid out in the flex container, by setting the direction of the flex
     container’s main axis. They can be laid out in two main directions,  like columns vertically or like rows horizontally.
     
     Note that row and row-reverse are affected by the layout direction (see `layoutDirection` property) of the flex container.
     If its text direction is LTR (left to right), row represents the horizontal axis oriented from left to right, and row-reverse
     from right to left; if the direction is rtl, it's the opposite.
